    <br>
    Every child will be allocated their own keyperson who will play a special part in your child's preschool experience.
    A keyperson has special responsibility for a specific child and his/her family to ensure the child's care and educational needs are met.<br><br>

    Prior to your child attending their settling in session, we offer a home visit when the Preschool Manager or Leader along with the Keyperson will make arrangements with you to meet you at your own home.
    The Keyperson's aim is to ensure your child is happy and feels secure at Bolton under 5, and to take responsibility to observe, encourage and extend your child's learning experiences.<br><br>

    We will notify you of your Keyperson's name in your welcome pack, and we will endeavour to ensure that they will be their assigned Keyperson throughout his/her time at Bolton under 5s. <br>
    However, unfortunately due to the sessional care offered at Bolton under 5s it is not always possible to mirror all of your child's sessions with their Keyperson.  <br>
    With this in mind all Practitioners take the time to get to know your child and build a bond to ensure that your child is happy and settled with every member of the team.<br><br>
