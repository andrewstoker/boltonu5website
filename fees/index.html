    With effect from 1st January 2017 the following fees are correct but maybe subject to change by the committee.<br><br>

    Please note that the committee have approved an increase to fees from 1st January 2017, which is referred to in the second paragraph below.<br><br>

    <h2>1. Non-refundable Reservation fees:</h2>

    The reservation fee for new starters is £30.00 which reserves the minimum requirement of 2 sessions and includes provision of a T-shirt and book bag upon starting at the preschool. Any additional sessions reserved at time of booking will cost £10 per session and will also be non-refundable. (Sessions are defined on the application form)<br><br>

    <h2>2. Hourly charges:</h2>

    The charges for your child attending the pre-school are as follows:<br><br>

    Under 3 years old - £5.25 per hour (previously £5.00)<br><br>

    Over 3 years old - £4.75 per hour (previously £4.50)<br><br>

    Please note, the cost per hour will reduce from the start of the week following their 3rd birthday.<br><br>

    Your child will be charged for all reserved hours (including family holidays or sickness), but will not be charged for bank holidays or INSET days.<br><br>

    <h2>3. Extra sessions:</h2>

    Any one-off/ad-hoc session will be charged at £5.75 per hour or part thereof, subject to availability.<br><br>

    Extra sessions can be paid in advance in cash or by cheque, which should be given to the preschool manager, or if not paid in advance will be invoiced at the beginning of the next half term. Any leavers attending extra sessions in their last half term must pay for their sessions in advance.<br><br>

    <h2>4. Session changes:</h2>

    PLEASE NOTE THAT ALL CHANGES MUST BE ADVISED IN WRITING OR BY EMAIL<br><br>

    Increases - requests to increase hours for the next half term can be made without incurring any charges until midway through the preceding half-term. Forthcoming cut off dates will be publicised at the beginning of the academic year and again in the preschool newsletter. After the cut-off date, changes cannot be made to hours scheduled for the next half term as staffing rotas will have been fixed. If there is any availability in the next half term there will be the option to pay for ad-hoc sessions - this will be charged at £5.75 per hour per child
    <br><br>

    <h2>2014-2015 cut-off dates for a request to increase hours at preschool:</h2>

    September 19th (for changes to Autumn term following October half term).<br>

    November 21st (for changes to Spring term until February half term).<br>

    January 23rd (for changes to Spring term following February half term).<br>

    March 13th (for changes to Summer term following Easter break).<br>

    May 8th (for changes to Summer term following May half term).<br>

    June 19th (for changes to Autumn term, academic year 2014-2015)<br><br>

    Decrease - Any request to decrease attendance at the preschool by more than 2 hours per week will incur a £20 admin charge. Decreases are only permitted prior to the cut-off dates mentioned above. Decreases after this time are not permitted and fees for all reserved sessions will be charged for the following half term.<br><br>

    Any sessions previously waitlisted for, which become available, will be offered without an administration fee being levied.<br><br>

    Should you choose to remove your child from Preschool, any monies paid in advance are non refundable. We require a minimum of 4 weeks written notice of this change, which should be posted to/given to the Preschool Manager at the above address or emailed to <a href="mailto:info@boltonunder5s.co.uk"> info@boltonunder5s.co.uk.</a><br><br>

    <h2>5. Funding:</h2>

    From the beginning of the term after your child reaches the age of 3, you may be entitled to up to 15 hours of free preschool care per week for 38 weeks per year, making a total of 570 hours. This is not an academic year as it may start from the Spring term or Summer term and hence could be as long as 39 or 40 weeks. If your child were doing 15 hours per week for 40 weeks they would be claiming 600 hours (40 weeks x 15), however the government do not allow you to claim that many and the extra 30 hours would be chargeable at our normal hourly rate, and will be invoiced accordingly.<br><br>

    All funded hours will be deducted from your invoice and then any remaining hours will be charged as above. It is up to you to make us aware of any hours that should be funded, as the number of hours will vary from child to child (for example if you use two different child care providers).<br><br>

    Funding application forms are issued each term to children who are eligible for funding, for you to complete and return to the preschool providing details of what hours you want funded. Funding applications cannot be amended once submitted so any changes or adhoc sessions will be charged at the hourly rate shown above.<br><br>

    <h2>6. Payments:</h2>

    Invoices showing both funded and unfunded hours, the balance due after funding as well as any relevant extra sessions and administration fees, will be emailed to you on a half-termly basis by the Preschool Administrator. Please arrange to make payment within 14 days of the invoice date. Payments can be made using the following methods: <br><br>

    - via any childcare voucher scheme (Email <a href="mailto:treasurer@boltonunder5s.com"> the treasurer for details</a>)<br>

    - by bank transfer (Email <a href="mailto:treasurer@boltonunder5s.com"> the treasurer for details</a>)<br>

    - by cheque which should be payable to BOLTON UNDER 5s PRESCHOOL, with your child’s name written on the back <br>

    - by cash <br><br>

    If paying cash or cheque, could we please ask you to put the payment in an envelope and on the front mark it with your child’s name and amount enclosed. Please hand these envelopes to either the preschool manager or deputy, who will provide you with a receipt.<br><br>

    If you run into any problem that would affect your ability to pay on time, please speak to the manager or deputy as soon as possible. <br><br>
