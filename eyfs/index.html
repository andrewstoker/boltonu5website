    <h2>Early Years Foundation Stage</h2>

    Bolton Under 5's Preschool is registered and inspected in line with the Early Years Foundation Stage (EYFS) framework. The EYFS is a stage of children’s development from birth to the end of their first (Reception) year in school.
    The EYFS Framework describes how early years practitioners should work with children and their families to support their learning and development. <br><br>
    The framework was revised for September 2014 to make it clearer, with more focus on children’s learning and with greater emphasis on working in partnerships with parents to support children’s learning at home.
    <br><br>
    The revised EYFS explains how and what your child will be learning to give them a firm foundation for a successful start at school. Your child will be learning skills, acquiring new knowledge and demonstrating their understanding through 7 areas of Learning and Development.
    <br><br>
    Of these, children usually develop the 3 Prime Areas first. These are:<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Communication and Language</li>
        <li>Physical DevelopmentPersonal</li>
        <li>Social and Emotional Development</li>
    </ul>
    As children grow these Prime Areas will help them to develop skills in the 4 Specific Areas:
    <ul>
        <li>Literacy</li>
        <li>Maths</li>
        <li>Understanding the world</li>
        <li>Expressive arts and design</li>
    </ul>
    These 7 areas are used to plan your child’s learning. At Bolton Under 5's  we use a fun, play based approach to supporting learning and development in the early years. Learning is guided by exceptional staff who skilfully support children’s learning and development through effective teaching. Each child’s learning and development is recorded and celebrated through a unique Tapestry Electronic Learning Journal.
