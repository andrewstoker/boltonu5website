	<h1>Ofstead Report</h1>
    <p>In February 2017 Ofsted carried out a scheduled inspection on our setting.</p>
    <p> The inspector was highly complimentary of our preschool and we would like to share with you some of her comments: </p>

    <p> Provision is Outstanding. <a href="https://reports.ofsted.gov.uk/inspection-reports/find-inspection-report/provider/CARE/109651">
        (click for full ofstead report) </a> </p>
    <p> The preschool is oustanding because: </p>
    <p> The staff are highly effective in using children's interests and everyday activities as a basis for challenging their thinking and learning.
        For example, when children are not interested in sitting still to learn numbers, staff develop their confidence in mathematics through other activities that increase their motivation.
    </p>
    <p> Staff prepare children exceptionally well for the next stages in their learning and for their moves to school.
        This includes children who are learning more than one language, children with disadvantaged starts in life, and children who are very able.
    </p>
    <p> Outcomes for all children are excellent, given their different starting points.</p>
