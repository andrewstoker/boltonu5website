    At Bolton Under 5’s Preschool we use ‘Tapestry’, to create your child’s learning journeys.  Tapestry is a platform which is supported and endorsed by Hampshire County Council, and is highly regarded by OFSTED (Office for standards in education).

    By logging on with a secure username and password you will be able to view all of your children’s observations, photographs and even video from their time at Preschool. You will even receive an email telling you when a new observation or piece of work is available for you to view. This will enable you to follow your child’s individual progress closely,  you can share your childs enjoyment of each day with them.  Tapestry also allows you to give us feedback and add comments so that together we are able to make your childs time with us really special. 

    Staff will reference your child’s learning to the EYFS (Early years foundation stage) profile so you will know which area of learning your child is achieving in, and the age-band that they were working in for that activity.

    All of this information is stored on a highly secure system, which is only accessible by our staff and you personally.  E-safety is extremely important to us at Bolton Under 5’s Preschool, and we will not share any details about your childs time with us without your permission.  We are confident that you will love following your childs Learning Journal,  as much as we love sharing their day with you.
