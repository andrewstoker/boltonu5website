    <br>
    Bolton Under 5s is managed by two committes:
    <h2>A management committee</h2>
    Members are elected by the parents of the children who attend the preschool.  We hold an election for new comittee members at our annual AGM.<br>

    <h2>A fundraising committee </h2>
    Members organise a variety of fun events during the year to raise extra funds for the benefit of the children in preschool. <br>
    <br><br>

    Both committess aid the preschool through:

    <ul>
        <li>Managing the preschool's finances</li>
        <li>Employing and managing the staff.</li>
        <li>Making sure the preschool has, and works to, policies that help it to provide a high quality service.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that the Principles of the EYFS are fully implemented</li>
        <li>Making sure the preschool works in partnership with the children's parents</li>
        <li>Arranging social and fundraising events.</li>
    </ul>
